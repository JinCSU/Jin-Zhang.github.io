## RESEARCH INTERESTS
Computer vision based sensing technique plays an important role in process industry monitoring, for the reason that hardware measuring instruments are unavailable or costly. However, hand-crafted image features are designed according to domain knowledge and usually they are adjusted to a specific working condition of the plant. Convolutional neural network is an important technique to encode the feature of object appearances. And it does not need to pay additional attention like hand-crafted image features to transfer a model trained in one domain to others domains. Thus, it brings a huge amount of conveniences to design a soft-sensor for process industry monitoring.
